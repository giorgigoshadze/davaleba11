            <p class="text">It is a long established fact that a reader will be<br>
                 distracted by the readable content of a page when<br>
                  looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum<br>
                   is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of<br>
                    letters, as opposed to using 'Content<br>
                     here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many<br> 
                     desktop publishing packages and web page editors<br>
                      now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,<br>
                       and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many<br>
                        web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have<br>
                         evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,<br>
                         sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the<br> like).
